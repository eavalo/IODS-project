# Logistic regression

## Data
The dataset has been constructed by joining two student alchol comsuption datasets which were downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance. The two datasets contain the same variables and the students are partially overlapping. The data was joined by using following columns as surrogate identifiers for students:

* *school, sex, age, address, famsize, Pstatus, Medu, Fedu, Mjob, Fjob, reason, nursery, internet*

The variables not used for joining have been combined by averaging for numeric columns and by taking the first answer for non-numeric columns. Two new variables have been define:

* *alc_use* is the average of *Dalc* and *Walc*
* *high_use* is TRUE if *alc_use* is hihger than 2 and FALSE otherwise

Read in the dataset.

```{r data_reading}
alc <- read.csv("~/git/IODS-project/data/alc.csv")
```

Variables in the data set:
```{r data_check}
str(alc)
```
